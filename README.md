> A simple yet powerful to-do list project designed to showcase fundamental front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence using `localStorage`.

### üöÄ Live Demo

You can access the live application here:

- **[TODOList](https://felCardoso.github.io/TODOList/)**

---

### ‚ú® Features

- **Add Tasks**: Input field to enter new tasks and add them to the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Click on a task's text to toggle its completed state.
- **Remove Tasks**: A dedicated button to delete individual tasks.
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage` and reloaded when the page is reopened.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents empty tasks from being added.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For semantic and organized structure.
- **CSS3**: For modern, responsive, and user-friendly styling using Flexbox.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For the application logic, event handling, and interactivity.
- **Web APIs**: `localStorage` for client-side data storage.

### üéØ Core Concepts & Key Learnings

Building this project was an excellent opportunity to deepen and solidify my knowledge in:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically creating, adding, and removing HTML elements.
- **Event Handling**: Mastering `addEventListener` and the powerful **Event Delegation** pattern for a more performant application.
- **Web Storage**: Understanding and implementing `localStorage` to persist user data.
- **Data Structures**: Converting data between the DOM and JavaScript data structures (Arrays of Objects) using `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`.
- **UX/UI Principles**: Focusing on a fluid user experience with visual feedback (hover effects, transitions) and intuitive features (add with 'Enter' key, auto-focus on input).
